* the list of [code releases];
* [open milestones];
* [closed milestones]; and
* [issues].

### (0.1.1.3)

Current [development version]

### [0.1.1.2]

Latest [release version], including fixes to documentation and CLI display bugs.

### [0.1.1.1]

[Breaking API changes](https://github.com/orome/crypto-enigma-hs/compare/ef97f8ac..62d0ff59):

* Change to [handling errors with `Either`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.2.2/docs/Control-Monad-Except.html#g:3)
  ([rather than](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53456278/656912) `Except`, eliminating the dependency on `mtl`).
* Removal of deprecated display functions from `Crypto.Enigma.Display`.

### [0.0.3.1]

Non-breaking API additions, adding [new CLI] with significant
[refactoring and additional features](https://github.com/orome/crypto-enigma-hs/compare/0.0.2.14...0.0.3.1):

* [Add](https://github.com/orome/crypto-enigma-hs/issues/13)
  [command line interface](https://github.com/orome/crypto-enigma-hs#functionality-command-line),
  using [optparse-applicative](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/optparse-applicative).
* Refactor display functions, deprecating `show...` functions and adding new display options.
* Encapsulate `EnigmaConfig` display options in
  [`DisplayOpts`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/crypto-enigma/docs/Crypto-Enigma-Display.html#DisplayOptsA)
  with a total constructor (coercing any bad values to defaults).
* More consistent and robust error handling in `EnigmaConfig` constructors
  (including restoring `readSpec` compliance in `read`).
* Add (export existing) [total constructor](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/crypto-enigma/docs/Crypto-Enigma.html#v:configEnigmaExcept)
  for `EnigmaConfig`.

  with an error when bad arguments are given.
* Convert all strings provided as `Message` arguments to valid machine input (see
  [`message`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/crypto-enigma/docs/Crypto-Enigma.html#v:message)).

### [0.0.2.5]

Initial Hackage version. First upload of package to Hackage, without

Stable enough for use, but not reviewed.
